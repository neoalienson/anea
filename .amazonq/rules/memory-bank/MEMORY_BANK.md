## Key Algorithms & Business Logic

### Matching Algorithm Components
```
KOL Suitability Score = (Audience Match * 0.4) +
                       (Content Relevance * 0.3) +
                       (Engagement Quality * 0.2) +
                       (Historical Performance * 0.1)
```

### Performance Targets
- API Response: < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Search Results: < 2 seconds
- Concurrent Users: 10,000+
- Uptime: 99.9%

## Security & Compliance Notes

### Authentication Strategy
